### Why are datasets split into chunks of 2GB

Github Large File storage has an upper limit of 2GB for organisations using Github Free. You can read about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage).

Tars generated by emergency backup script are split with the `split` command. Read about how to use it [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/61774/create-a-tar-archive-split-into-blocks-of-a-maximum-size).

If you are adding a new dataset zip, split it first by doing

```
tar -zcvf - filename.tar.gz | split -b 1900m - filename.tar.gz.part.
```
